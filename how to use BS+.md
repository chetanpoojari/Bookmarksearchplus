### **Q4: How do I reset my BS+ settings?**

*   There are no settings which changes the tools behaviour. Deleting will not help in the same.

### **Q5: Why Does Bookmark Search Plus Use Tags Instead of Multiple Folders?**

Many users ask why **Bookmark Search Plus (BS+) uses a tag-based system** instead of relying solely on nested folders for organization. Here‚Äôs why **tags offer a more efficient and flexible solution:**

#### **1\. Tags Provide Multi-Dimensional Organization**

*   **Folders are hierarchical**, meaning each bookmark **can only exist in one folder at a time**.
    
*   **Tags allow bookmarks to belong to multiple categories** simultaneously.
    
    *   Example: A webpage about **AI in Product Management** could be placed in a **‚ÄúProduct Management‚Äù** folder or an **‚ÄúAI‚Äù** folder, but **not both**.
        
    *   With tags, you can simply label it as **#AI #ProductManagement**, making it accessible under both categories.
        

#### **2\. Faster and More Efficient Search**

*   Searching through folders requires **navigating a structured tree**, which can be slow.
    
*   With tags, **you can find bookmarks instantly** by searching for a keyword or clicking on a relevant tag.
    

#### **3\. Dynamic and Scalable Bookmarking**

*   As the number of bookmarks grows, folder structures become **complex and harder to manage**.
    
*   Tags scale effortlessly ‚Äì **no need to reorganize folders**, just tag and search as needed.
    

#### **4\. More Intuitive and Modern Approach**

*   Many modern productivity tools (e.g., **Notion, Evernote, Google Keep**) use **tags over folders** because they provide a **more flexible** and **user-friendly** way to organize information.
    
*   BS+ applies the same logic, making bookmark retrieval **quicker and more intuitive**.
    

üìå **Bottom Line:** **Tags empower users with a fast, flexible, and scalable way to manage bookmarks, without the rigidity of nested folders.** üöÄ
